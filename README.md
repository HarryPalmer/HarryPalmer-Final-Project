Welcome to my final project for CSET3100. This website shows some off some of the website design practices I learned during this course.

The site currently is using the following:
- Customized Fonts
- Custom Color Schemes that unify the look and feel of the website
- Google Analytics to track what is going on with the website
- JQuery Scripts to show an Image Slideshow that is controlled by the user
- Custom Social Media icons to point users to my current social media sites from the Font-Awesome website with customized hover/select color schemes to match the rest of the website
- Contact Section for users to send emails to me that have been customized for look and feel for the rest of the site
- Custom sizing of controls as the media size of the web page changes
- JQuery button to hide elements of the page
